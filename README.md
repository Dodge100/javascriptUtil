# JavaScriptUtil
JavaScriptUtil or JSUtil for short is a collection of js functions and utilities that anyone can use to speed up their coding process.

## Goals
My goal with this project is to create an expandable and easily usable collection of javascript tools or utilities. I wanted a quick collection that anyone could use. I also tried to comment the code so that when using, it isn't some magic oracle, it is a piece of code that you understand.

## Execution
This is my preliminary set of functions. I hope to expand upon this more by adding features like easy modal creation and usage, as well as executing code based off of the properties of HTML elements.

## Deployment
Use the following code in the \<head>.

```html
<script src="https://dodge100.github.io/javascriptUtil/javascriptUtil.js"></script>
```
